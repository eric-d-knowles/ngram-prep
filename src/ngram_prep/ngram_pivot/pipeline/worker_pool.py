    Process that loops: reads buffer_size shards, writes them, repeats.

    Strategy:
    1. Pull buffer_size unit IDs from shared queue
    2. Read those shards into memory (PARALLEL across workers)
    3. Acquire write lock (SERIAL)
    4. Write batch
    5. Release lock and repeat

    This keeps workers continuously busy with bounded memory usage.

    Ingest all completed shards with N parallel worker processes.

    Strategy:
    - N worker processes (num_ingest_readers)
    - Each worker reads buffer_shards into memory before writing
    - Workers take turns acquiring write lock to dump their batch
    - True parallelism during reads (no GIL), serial writes (no contention)

    Memory Usage:
    - Each shard ~150MB average
    - Total RAM = num_readers * buffer_shards * 150MB
    - Example: 8 workers * 3 shards = 24 shards * 150MB = ~3.6GB RAM

    Benefits:
    - ✅ No queue serialization overhead (no pickle)
    - ✅ True parallel reads across N workers (no Python GIL)
    - ✅ Each worker buffers multiple shards for better I/O throughput
    - ✅ Serial writes eliminate RocksDB lock contention
    - ✅ Large batches minimize commit overhead
